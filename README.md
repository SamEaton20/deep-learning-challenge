# deep-learning-challenge
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
# Preprocess
- Read in the charity_data.csv to a Pandas DataFrame
- Drop the EIN and NAME columns.
- Determine the number of unique values for each column.
- For columns that have more than 10 unique values, determine the number of data points for each unique value.
- Use the number of data points for each unique value to pick a cutoff point to combine "rare" categorical variables together in a new value, Other, and then check if the replacement was successful.
- Use pd.get_dummies() to encode categorical variables.
- Split the preprocessed data into a features array, X, and a target array, y. Use these arrays and the train_test_split function to split the data into training and testing datasets.
- Scale the training and testing features datasets by creating a StandardScaler instance, fitting it to the training data, then using the transform function.
# Compile, Train, Evalute Model
- Create a neural network model by assigning the number of input features and nodes for each layer using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Create the first hidden layer and choose an appropriate activation function.
- If necessary, add a second hidden layer with an appropriate activation function.
- Create an output layer with an appropriate activation function.
- Check the structure of the model.
- Compile and train the model.
- Create a callback that saves the model's weights every five epochs.
- Evaluate the model using the test data to determine the loss and accuracy
# Optimize the Model
- Adjust the input data to ensure that no variables or outliers are causing confusion in the model, such as:
  - Dropping more or fewer columns.
  - Creating more bins for rare occurrences in columns.
  - Increasing or decreasing the number of values for each bin.
  - Add more neurons to a hidden layer.
  - Add more hidden layers.
  - Use different activation functions for the hidden layers.
  - Add or reduce the number of epochs to the training regimen
